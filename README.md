# Ruby Reins

This is a simplified rebuilding of a typical MVC framework (based on Rails).

It is a learning project to broaden my general understanding of web servers/applications and to deeply understand many of the more automagical aspects of Rails specifically.

Currently it does the following:
 - Autoload controllers and actions of the format 'http://host/controller/action
 - Autoload views that are stored in `app/views/view_name.html.erb`
